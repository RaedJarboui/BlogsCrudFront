1.The blogs list page:

Displays a list of blogs previews
Each blog has a title, content, author, an upvote and downvote buttons.
Each blog has ‘continue reading’ link that redirect to the detailed blog page.
For each blog, the style is determined by the upvote/downvote ratio.
(For example, the blog preview’s border should be green if the upvotes are more than the downvotes or red otherwise) :
*Blogs having more upvotes than downvotes
